The tag will, once un-mangled, unpack as the "mailto" attribute of the <a> tag.
eg: <a href="mailto:martin.paulo@versi.edu.au">Martin Paulo</a>

There will be no options for subjects/bodies etc as these appear to be browser specific extensions. The basic 
specification is defined in http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt and http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/#z8 (address 
specification). No subject/body/cc/bcc is mentioned...

The total length of the string attribute is limited to 256 characters.
